### Obtaining the Python package manager 'pip'

I've already covered this [in my Linux documentation](../Linux.md#python-packages). There are two macOS caveats I know of. 

- Install and use the `python3` package. As of February 2018, the default Python version on macOS High Sierra is 2.7. How cutting edge.
- Add `$HOME/Library/Python/3.6/bin` to your PATH.
