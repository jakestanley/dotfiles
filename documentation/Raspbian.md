# Raspbian

This readme is all about setups for really lightweight environments with the basics.

I'm designing it to be based around the Raspberry Pi 3. It's a great piece of kit with a quad core CPU, but only a gigabyte of memory. I'd like to get into using such a low power computer for more tasks as it's more than capable of a bunch of things I'd normally use a full power laptop for.

Speaking of the Raspberry Pi, as it can easily be moved around and plugged into a TV and the such, I'd like to design this setup for a mouseless environment.

## Principles

- Complexity and configuration over comfort
- Keep It Simple, Stupid
- Outsource
